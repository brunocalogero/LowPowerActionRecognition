This will hold the documentation for all research made on CNN, use it as a means to keep track of the work you have done
and, eventually, as something that allows people to understand what you have been up to. This will also contain all the results obtained

Use this to also keep track of all the resources that you have used to come up with your solution.

As a starting point, create a basic classifier using either the MNIST dataset or the setup:
```
 PIX2NVS ---- pixel frame ----- state of the art pixel frame classifier
                  |
                  |
              DVS data ---- classifier friendly format data ---- DVS classifier
```


This will also hold how the CCN is integrated in the overall system, benefits of using one classifier over the other and most importantly, benchmarks.
Don't be scared to send personal emails to Yiannis asking questions and what not to gather a better understanding of what the expectations are here.
